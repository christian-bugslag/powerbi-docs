# Known issue #178 - Multi-role row-level security for composite models may fail

In some cases, multi-role row-level security (RLS) for composite models may fail and result in an error.  The error occurs because an incorrect response is given when trying to view the data from the composite model.


**APPLIES TO:** :::image type="icon" source="../../includes/media/yes-icon.svg" border="false"::: Row-level security (RLS)

**Status:** Fixed: Dec 22, 2022

**Problem area:** Consume and View


## Symptoms

If you face this issue, you will see an error similar to:
> The user belongs to multiple roles 'role name' that have security filters, which isn't supported when one of the roles has filters affecting table 'table name' with SecurityFilteringBehavior=Both relationships.

## Solutions and workarounds

Fix has been deployed and the above error has been removed. Users who belong to multiple roles for composite models will experience the same behavior as users who belong to multiple roles for non-composite models: they'll have access to all the data that each individual role has access to. For example, if role 'A' has access to Product[Color] = "Black" and role 'B' has access to Product[Color] = "Red", a user who belongs to both role 'A' and 'B' will have access to Product[Color] = "Black" or "Red".
